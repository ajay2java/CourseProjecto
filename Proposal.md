# Project Proposal

## The big idea: 

Our project aims to automate the process of advising student course registration at Babson. We plan to do this by implementing a tool that will take student inputs of all courses they have taken and matches the studentâ€™s inputs with graduation requirements to suggest which courses they should be taking next semester. The minimum viable product we wish to produce is a website that takes user inputs such as year and desired concentration and designs a possible schedule for them. Our stretch goal would be to incorporate many more functionalities such as asking the user to provide school year and all courses taken as well as student goals and desired concentrations to tailor a schedule that would accomplish both graduation requirements and student goals via an excel sheet that we will feed through the program.  

 

## Learning objectives: 

We both wish to learn more about how python can interact with files as well as how to most effectively use HTML and python to produce an analytical program/algorithm to help other Babson students reach their goals before graduation.  

 

## Implementation plan: 

Initially, we will select the appropriate technology stack for our project, using HTML the user interface of our website and Python powering the backend algorithm. To enhance the seamless integration of these technologies, our team will explore Python libraries for file manipulation and frameworks that bridge Python with HTML, ensuring a robust and interactive user experience. 

As we progress, the development of a Minimum Viable Product will be our central focus. This MVP, a basic yet functional iteration of our vision, will be crafted through an initial prototype design, emphasizing simplicity and user-friendliness. The heart of our MVP lies in a Python script, tailored to match user inputs with a meticulously curated list of courses and graduation prerequisites. Once the algorithm development is complete we will move on to designing and producing the website through which the algorithm will run. The focus of our website development will be ease of use and simplicity.  

After building our MVP we aim to enhance our project further. We'll upgrade our Python algorithm for greater complexity, addressing prerequisites and schedule clashes. Additionally, we're planning to simplify data input, moving from manual entry to a streamlined model that takes a file like a degree worksheet and extracts the necessary data from it.
